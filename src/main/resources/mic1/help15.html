In this example you will see how the simulator operates at different
 <i>speeds</i>. Here <i>speed</i> means the amount of computation that
 takes place when the   <img src="images/rarrow.gif" hspace=5> button is clicked once. You will also see how to
 use the <font color="red">Delay</font> Mode to demonstrate the action of the simulator.<p> 
<ol ><li >Launch the simulator and from
 <b>File | Assemble/Load IJVM program ....</b> select
 <b><font color="#006060">examples/JAS-IJVM/add.jas</font></b>. Load the program when it finishes
 assembling. <li >Try it first at <font color="red">Prog</font> Speed. This program adds 2 hexidecimal numbers. Run the program, and type the following into the
 Input Console: <blockquote> 
<pre>
1234   	
5678
</pre>
 </blockquote> Note the echoing in the Output Console. When you are done, the
 Output Console should contain
 <blockquote> 
<pre>
 1234
+5678
========
000068AC
</pre>
 </blockquote> You can enter another pair of numbers to sum in the Input
 Console. (Be sure to use capitals <tt>A ... F</tt> for the high-end  hex digits.) Click   <img src="images/stop.gif" hspace=5> when you are done. <li >Now click Reset, and change the speed to IJVM Speed. <li >Click the   <img src="images/rarrow.gif" hspace=5> button several times, and note the highlighting of
 IJVM instructions in the Method Area. Each click executes a single
 IJVM instruction. You can also click the   <img src="images/larrow.gif" hspace=5> button to backup a step. <li >Now select <font color="red">Delay On</font> (another radio button) and click
 Reset and the Run button as in the previous step. Note that the
 sequence of microcode instructions used to interpret the current IJVM
 instruction is shown, and the data path is illustrated in the
 Architecture View (the leftmost window showing the registers and
 busses). <li >Select <font color="red">Delay Off</font> and <font color="red">Clock</font> Speed, then   <img src="images/reset.gif" hspace=5>  and Run several steps. Each step shows the execution of one
 microinstruction. The Reverse button backs up one
 microinstruction. On the Menu Bar select <b>Microstore | View
 Microstore</b>. The Microstore Window will appear, and you can follow the
 execution of the microprogram while clicking Run. Try it with
 <font color="red">Delay On</font> to see the subcycles illustrated as before. <li >Finally, select <font color="red">Delay Off</font> and <font color="red">SubClock</font> Speed,
 then Reset and Run several steps. Each step is now a quarter
 cycle.   <img src="images/larrow.gif" hspace=5> works as you'd expect, but <font color="red">Delay On</font> has no effect at
 this speed. </ol> <p>
