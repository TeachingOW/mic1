Once a JAS file has been assembled and loaded, it can be re-assembled
 and loaded using <b>Assemble/Load | Current JAS Assemble/Load</b> without
 requiring further file selection. This example also shows what happens
 when there is an error in a JAS program.<p> 
<ol ><li >After completing Example 1, re-edit <b><font color="#006060">ijvmtest.jas</font></b>, remove
 the colon after OK, and save the changes: <blockquote> 
<pre>
OK	BIPUSH 65
	OUT
	BIPUSH 79
	OUT
	BIPUSH 75
	OUT
	HALT
</pre>
 </blockquote> <li >On the simulator select from the Menu Bar
 <b>Assemble/Load | Current JAS Assemble/Load</b> The <i>Assembling
 ijvmtest.jas</i> window should appear with the following error message: <blockquote> 
<pre>
IJVM Assembler...
1433: Invalid instruction: ok
1424: Invalid goto label: ok
</pre>
 </blockquote> <li >Close the window and re-edit the file: put back the colon and
 remove the lines
 <blockquote> 
<pre>
BIPUSH 65
OUT
</pre>
 </blockquote> so that the program looks like it did originally. <li >Try Step 2 again, this time without errors. Load the program, click
 the Reset button, and run it again. The result in the Output
 Console should be "OK", just like the first time. </ol> <p>
