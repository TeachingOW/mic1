                    <p> 
The <i><font color="blue">Mic-1 MMV</font></i> software requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.4 or later. Visit
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" target=_blank>http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a> to find a JDK or JRE for your platform.<p> 
If you are installing from the CD-ROM, you have already copied the
 folder Mic1MMV to your drive. Skip to Step 2.<p> 
<ol ><li >If your are installing from the Website, you need to unpack before
 proceeding. <dl> <dt>Windows NT/XP unpacking<dd>Run the self-extracting zip file <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV.exe</font></b>. The folder
 <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV</font></b> will be created and all program files, source code, and
 documentation will be extracted into that folder.<p> 
<dt>Unix/Linux unpacking<dd>To decompress Mic1MMV.tar.gz under Unix-like operating systems,
 you'll need the GNU gunzip program or other compatible
 decompression software, and the tar program. GNU software is
 available from a number of FTP sites which are listed at
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html</a>. If you're using gunzip, at a
 shell prompt, type: <blockquote> 
<pre>
$ gunzip mic1.tar.gz
$ tar xvf Mic1MMV.tar
</pre>
 </blockquote> You may instead be able to do this in one step if you're using GNU tar: <blockquote> 
<pre>
$ tar xzf Mic1MMV.tar.gz 
</pre>
 </blockquote> This will create the Mic1MMV directory, as in Windows
 unpacking.<p> 
<dt>Macintosh unpacking<dd>Double-click (or open with Stuffit Expander) the file
 <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV.tar.gz</font></b>. This will create the folder Mic1MMV, as in  Windows unpacking. </dl> <p> 
<li >There are two jar files in the Mic1MMV folder: <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV_lr.jar</font></b> is
 designed to work on low resolution screens, while
 <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV_hr.jar</font></b> is intended for high resolution screens. If
 you are using a resolution of 1280 x 960 or higher, you should use
 <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV_hr.jar</font></b>; otherwise use <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV_lr.jar</font></b>.<p> 
<i>Note: When Mic1MMV is launched, it automatically loads a microcode
 program. At first this program is <b><font color="#006060">mic1ijvm.mic1</font></b>, the IJVM microcode
 interpreter described in Chapter 4 of <font color="blue">Tanenbaum, <i>Structured Computer
 Organization</i>, <math>5<sup>th</sup></math> Edition</font>. You can load a different
 microprogram once Mic1MMV is running, or even specify a different
 microprogram to load on startup. See the User Guide for details.</i><p> 
<li ><dl> <dt>Windows users:<dd>make sure your PATH variable points to the Java
 bin directory (Java installation should take care of this).<p> 
<dt>Unix/Linux users:<dd>set the PATH environment variables. In order
 to run any of the Mic-1 MMV software, the PATH variable must
 contain the path of the JDK executables. To see if the PATH is set
 correctly, type which java. If a directory path is returned, the
 PATH is properly set. If nothing is returned, you need to find the
 jdk and then set the PATH.<p> 
<dt>Mac OSX users:<dd>check that the Java JRE is properly installed on
 your machine. You should be able to launch the jar files by double
 clicking on their icons. </dl> <p> 
<li >Try both <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV_hr.jar</font></b> and <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV_lr.jar</font></b>, and
 rename the appropriate file <b><font color="#006060">Mic1MMV.jar</font></b>. Launch, either by
 double-clicking the icon or with the terminal console command: <blockquote> 
<pre>
java -jar Mic1MMV.jar
</pre>
 </blockquote> Alternatively, edit the batch file runMic1.bat and use it to launch
 the simulator. Instructions for editing runMic1.bat are contained
 in that file. </ol> <p>
