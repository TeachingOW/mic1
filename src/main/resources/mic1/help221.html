                     You can use <i><font color="blue">Mic-1 MMV</font></i>'s IJVM Assembler to practice writing assembly
 language programs, which you can then test on the simulator. Read the  <a href="help31.html#jas">JAS Language Specification</a> for an
 explanation of the structure of an IJVM program. <ul ><li >Using your favorite text editor, create a text file which contains
 your Java Assembly Language (JAS) program. We have adopted the
 convention of using <tt>.jas</tt> as the file name suffix to indicate
 that it is a "Java Assembly" language file.<p> 
You may want to create a copy of echo.jas or add.jas and modify it to
 suit your needs. <li >Launch the simulator
 <li >Select <b>File | Assemble / Load JAS file ...</b>. Navigate to
 your file and select it. <li >The JAS Assembler View window should appear. If
 <tt>assembly complete</tt> appears in the text area you can click
 the <b>Load</b> button to read the IJVM program into the
 Method Area; otherwise, if error messages appear in the assembly
 window, correct the errors and try again. </ul>  Your IJVM program is now loaded into the <i><font color="blue">Mic-1 MMV</font></i> simulator. You can
 view the program in the Method Area. IJVM execution can be observed
 best by running the simulator at <font color="red">IJVM</font> or <font color="red">Prog</font> speed.<p> 
<i>If you modify your JAS program, you can reassemble and reload the
 current IJVM program by using <b>Assemble/Load | Current JAS
 Assemble/Load</b></i>.<p>
