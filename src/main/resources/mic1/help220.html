                   You can use <i><font color="blue">Mic-1 MMV</font></i> to write your own microprograms for the Mic1 architecture. Read the  <a href="help30.html#mal">MAL Language Specification</a> for an
 explanation of the structure of a microprogram. <ul ><li >Using your favorite text editor, create a text file which
 contains the Micro Assembly Language (MAL) text for your microprogram. We have adopted the convention of using <tt>.mal</tt> as the file name
 suffix to indicate that it is a "Micro Assembly Language" file.<p> 
You may want to create a copy of mic1ijvm.mal and modify it to
 suit your needs. <li >Launch the simulator
 <li >Select <b>File | Assemble / Load MAL file ...</b>. Navigate to
 your file and select it. <li >The MAL Assembler View window should appear. If
 <tt>assembly complete</tt> appears in the text area you can click
 the <b>Load</b> button to read the microcode program into the
 microstore; otherwise, if error messages appear in the assembly
 window, correct the errors and try again. </ul>  Your microprogram is now loaded into the <i><font color="blue">Mic-1 MMV</font></i> simulator. You can
 view the program by opening the Microstore View window (<b>Microstore | View Microstore</b>). Microinstruction execution can be
 observed by running the simulator at <font color="red">Clock</font> or <font color="red">SubClock</font> speed.<p> 
<i>If you modify your MAL program, you can reassemble and reload the
 current microprogram by using <b>Assemble/Load | Current MAL
 Assemble/Load</b></i>.<p> 
<i>Note that if you add new instructions to IJVM you may also need
 to modify the instruction set of the JAS assembler. This is described in the section</i>  <a href="help222.html#modify@jas">Modifying the JAS
 Assembler</a>.<p>
