                     The three Memory Views shows the <i><font color="blue">Mic-1 MMV</font></i>memory as three different
 segments. The base address and size of each area are specified by
  <a href="help203.html#pref">Preference</a> entries. The user can also set preferences
 for enabling Memory View tracking and highlighting. Tracking refers to  automatic scrolling of Memory Views to active locations during
 simulation. Highlighting, when enabled, will shows these in alternate
 colors. Highlighting in the Stack Area will displays the complete
 current stack. Note that the Method Area displays individual bytes,
 while the Constant Pool and Stack Area are shown as 4-byte words. <p>  <img src="images/memory.gif"> <p>
